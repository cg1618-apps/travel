"""The catch-all must not shadow the API.

Nothing has run `npm run build` when this suite runs - CI builds the frontend
in a later step - so `frontend_dist/` need not exist and the module-level
`app` then never mounts the catch-all at all: a test built against that
`app` would pass by finding nothing to test. These tests build
a fresh app via `create_app()` against a `tmp_path` directory that always
has an `index.html` and an `assets/` directory, so the catch-all is mounted
in every environment, built frontend or not.
