"""The production compose file's invariants.

These are the properties that are easy to break by accident and expensive to
notice: a published port exposes the app outside the tunnel, a missing restart
policy means the box comes back from a power cut without the app, and a probe
against "/" reports healthy with the database down.

The file these assert against is never exercised by this suite - it runs on a
machine CI cannot reach - so structure is the only thing that can be checked
here. That makes it worth checking.

The ingress is not this repository's business. PostgreSQL and the Cloudflare
Tunnel belong to cg1618-apps/platform, and the tunnel's rules are generated
there from apps.yml. What remains here is the end of the contract this
repository owns: the network alias the generated ingress points at.

This app has no uploads, so unlike media there are no bind mounts to assert.
