"""The request id: where it comes from, and what is refused.

travel is `exposure: cloudflare-access`, so unlike food this header does not
arrive from an unauthenticated stranger - Access answers before the request
reaches the box. The rule is asserted identically anyway. The collector indexes
every app together so the contract cannot be per-app, and `exposure` is one
line in `apps.yml` that this app is expected to change one day: a validator
that was only correct while the app was private is one nobody would remember
to add on the day it went public.

The rejections below are the point of this file; the acceptance is here so that
a validator which refused *everything* cannot pass them all.
