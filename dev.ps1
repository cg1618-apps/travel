# Local dev launcher: shared Postgres (docker) + uvicorn (--reload) + vite frontend.

# Ported from media/dev.ps1, changed only where travel's arrangement differs:
# this app has no docker-compose.yml of its own - the container is
# anime_site_postgres_db, owned by media's compose project, with a `travel`
# database created inside it by the platform's provisioning (see
# .env.example). So this script starts that container if it is stopped rather
# than running `docker-compose up`, and never touches its volume or project.

# --- box-wide (see apps.yml) - this must abort rather than fall back to another port,
# --- or it would silently take a slot another app on this laptop owns.
