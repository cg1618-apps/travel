# Ported from media/dev.ps1, changed only where travel's arrangement differs:
# this app has no docker-compose.yml of its own - the container is
# cg1618-dev-db, owned by the PLATFORM's compose project, with a `travel`
# database created inside it by the platform's provisioning (see
# .env.example). So this script brings that project up rather than owning a
# compose file of its own, and never touches its volume.

# --- box-wide (see apps.yml) - this must abort rather than fall back to another port,
