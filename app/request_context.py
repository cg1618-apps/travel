"""The request id that ties a log line to the request that produced it.

Four applications share one tunnel and one log collector, so a line saying
"IntegrityError" is worth very little on its own. Every line logged while
handling a request carries the same `request_id`, and the response carries it
back in `X-Request-ID`, so a reader who saw a failure in the browser can find
every line that belongs to it.

The contract is the platform's `docs/logging.md`; this file is travel's half
of it, and deliberately matches media's and food's rather than improving on
them.

Pure ASGI rather than `BaseHTTPMiddleware`: that class runs the rest of the
application in a task of its own, and a `ContextVar` set around `call_next`
then lives in a different context from the endpoint that logs. Setting the
variable here happens in the same task that awaits the app below it, so the
value is simply in scope.

# travel is `exposure: cloudflare-access`, so unlike media and food this
# value does NOT arrive from an unauthenticated stranger - Access answers
# before the request reaches the box. The rule is identical anyway, for two
# reasons: the contract is the same for every app because the collector indexes
# all of them together, and `exposure` is one line in apps.yml that this app is
# expected to change one day. A validator that was only correct while the app
# was private is one nobody would remember to add on the day it went public.
#
# A generated id is 32 hex characters, so anything that is not a short, boring
# token is replaced rather than trusted: an unbounded value is a per-line tax
# on the collector's storage, and a reused one makes correlation lie while the
# log still reads as coherent.
