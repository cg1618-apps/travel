"""Logging configured once, explicitly, at startup.

A `dictConfig` at startup is half an hour of work and is then never thought
about again. The alternative - `logging.basicConfig` running as an import side
effect - makes the root level depend on which module happened to be imported
first, and `basicConfig` is a no-op once any handler exists, so under a
different entrypoint the level silently differs. media was the counterexample
until it was fixed; this app never had either, which is why this file arrives
before there is anything much to log.

The format is the platform's, not this app's: plain text in development, JSON
lines in production, so the collector on the box indexes fields instead of
regexing sentences. Every application emits the same field names - `timestamp`,
`level`, `logger`, `message`, `app`, `request_id` - and the contract is the
platform repository's `docs/logging.md`; this file implements it. Nothing here
writes a file. The process logs to stdout and the runtime decides what becomes
of it.
