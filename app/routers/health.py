"""Liveness that touches the database, for the deploy ladder and the container.

Three conditions are checked - the database is reachable, both revisions are
readable, and the two are equal - and the last is the one nothing else on the
box would notice. After a failed migration-bearing deploy the database holds the
new revision while the image has rolled back to code that has never heard of
it. The site still serves pages. Row counts still look right. Only a
comparison between what the schema SAYS it is and what the code EXPECTS
catches that.

The path is public - there is no such thing as an internal path behind the
platform's ingress - and says only whether the app is serving.

The revision is read from `alembic_version.version_num` and from nowhere
else: not from an image's revision files, not from `alembic heads` against
the database. Two authoritative answers that can disagree mid-deploy is worse
than one.
